# app

This is a sample template for app - Below is a brief explanation of what we have generated for you:

```bash
.
├── README.md                   <-- This instructions file
├── app                         <-- Source code for a lambda function
│   ├── main.go                 <-- Lambda function code
│   └── Dockerfile              <-- Dockerfile
├── samconfig.toml              <-- SAM CLI configuration file
└── template.yaml
```

## Features

- [x] Use distroless image to build, The image size is only a few MB.
- [x] Migrate to AWS SAM without changing your faber code using [aws-lambda-adapter](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter).

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

You may need the following for local testing.
* [Golang](https://golang.org)

## Setup process

### Installing dependencies & building the target 

In this example we use the built-in `sam build` to build a docker image from a Dockerfile and then copy the source of your application inside the Docker image.  
Read more about [SAM Build here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html) 

### Local development

**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:3000 lambdafunction

curl http://localhost
Hello, World!
```

## Packaging and deployment

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

The command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

* **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching your project name.
* **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to.
* **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
* **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modifies IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
* **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

You can find your API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

# Appendix

### Golang installation

Please ensure Go 1.x (where 'x' is the latest version) is installed as per the instructions on the official golang website: https://golang.org/doc/install

A quickstart way would be to use Homebrew, chocolatey or your linux package manager.

#### Homebrew (Mac)

Issue the following command from the terminal:

```shell
brew install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade golang
```

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

Issue the following command from the powershell:

```shell
choco install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
choco upgrade golang
```
